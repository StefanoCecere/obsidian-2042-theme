# 2042 dark theme for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)

A minimal dark theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
I wanted just to change main colors, font and editor width, so to keep the theme as much as possibile compatibile with Obsidian evolution.

## Install

1. Download the `obsidian.css` file.
2. In Obsidian click Settings->Appearance and turn on `Apply Custom CSS`.
3. Put the `obsidian.css` in your vault root folder.
4. Restart Obsidian.

_The theme font are SF Mono or Menlo, so make sure you have them activated_
